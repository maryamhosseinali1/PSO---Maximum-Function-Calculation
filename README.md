Features:
1) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): The algorithm simulates a group of particles (potential solutions) moving through the solution space to find the global maximum of the function.
2) Customizable Parameters: Users can modify key PSO parameters such as the number of particles, iterations, and inertia to explore different convergence behaviors.
   
Files:
PSO-maximum of function.py: Python implementation of the PSO algorithm to find the maximum value of a function.
PSO-maximum of function.html: HTML file to visualize the optimization process, displaying particle movement and function evaluation in real-time.
